\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among females worldwide.%~\cite{cancerStatistics2011}.
Nevertheless, death by breast cancer are highly reduced by early treatment.
Thus, to run a chance of surviving breast cancer, it is uttermost important the early detection of malignant tumors.
This has motivated the establishment of \acp{bsp} to facilitate this breast cancer detection at an early stage.
Despite X-ray \dm is considered the gold standard technique for \bsp, other screening techniques like \us and \mri are being investigated
to overcome \dm limitations due to tissue superposition which can either mimic or obscure malignant pathology,
and avoid X-ray radiation all together.
